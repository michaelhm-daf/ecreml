Description: This R-package complements the statistcal methodology outlined in Mumford et al. (2023) 
	that enables environmental covariates (ECs) to be incorporated into the multi-environment trial (MET) analysis
	of agricultural consisting of Genotype x Environment x Management (GxExM) interaction effects. Specifically, 
	this R-package contains a suite of functions that automate the process of identifying key ECs contributing to the
	GxExM interaction after a baseline model is fitted using the asreml R-package tat does not contain any EC information.
