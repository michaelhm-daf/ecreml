abstract = {The design of large-scale field trials where the residuals are correlated has been of recent interest, in large part because of advances in statistical and computational methods of anal- ysis. The construction of designs for correlated data has typically used A-optimality and is computationally intensive. This involves calculating the inverse of the information matrix for treatments under the supervision of an optimization strategy that explores the design space. We propose an approximation to A-optimality, using nearest-neighbour balance, that is less computationally demanding and can achieve at least 95\% efficiency relative to A-optimality in many practical situations.},

abstract = {Exploring and exploiting variety by environment (V × E) interaction is one of the major challenges facing plant breeders. In paper I of this series, we presented an approach to modelling V × E interaction in the analysis of complex multi-environment trials using factor analytic models. In this paper, we develop a range of statistical tools which explore V × E interaction in this context. These tools include graphical displays such as heat-maps of genetic correlation matrices as well as so-called E-scaled uniplots that are a more informative alternative to the classical biplot for large plant breeding multi-environment trials. We also present a new approach to prediction for multi-environment trials that include pedigree information. This approach allows meaningful selection indices to be formed either for potential new varieties or potential parents.},

@article{ElYousfi2002,
abstract = {Net blotch incited by Pyrenophora teres f. teres is an important constraint for barley production in the semi-arid regions of Morocco, reaching epidemic proportions under favorable weather conditions. In this study, we generated 480 epidemics. These epidemics were characterized at five sites and for six different varieties with plants either inoculated by the pathogen or treated with fungicide tilt (propiconazle) 250 a.i. ha-1. The study was conducted in two growing seasons (1995-1996 and 1996-1997). Disease severity and area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) were related to grain yield. Critical-point model (CPM) and multiple-point model (MPM) did not explain the yield variability encountered and were not investigated further. For the same reason, the relationship between the AUDPC and yield was discarded. Disease effect on yield loss was closely related to yield potential in each growing season, and could not be used to predict yield or yield losses. Estimated yield losses due to net blotch varied between 14 and 29\% with resistant varieties out yielding susceptible varieties by 39\% when there was no disease control and by 56\% under fungicide treatment. Varietal resistance is essential to the control of barley net blotch. A response surface model based on grain yield, AUDPC and growth stage explained most of the yield variability (R2 = 0.94). This model was validated with 13 barley varieties and two mixtures. The fitting of this response surface model predicted grain yields within ±200 kg ha-1 when tested from booting to flowering stages. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The relationship between disease and yield is most often summarized as a simple empirical model that describes average crop performances is the presence of a pathogen. Such models may be robust and useful for surveys but their use is usually constrained to the specific conditions under which the modal was developed. Changes in production system usually invalidate the relationship. The alternative is to base the relationship on an epidemiological analysis of the pathogen population and a physiological concept of host growth and development. This review provides the knowledge and conceptual basis and discusses the limitations to progress in the development of such models. It is shown that a host-based assessment of disease is well suited to yield investigations and to multiple pest constraints, and that disease is logically related to yield via radiation interceptions and radiation use efficiency.},

abstract = {The effects of common wheat cultivars and fungicide (triadimefon) spray intervals (at 7-, 14-, 21-, 28-d, and no spray) on the temporal epidemics of stripe or yellow rust caused by Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici were studied. The experiments were conducted in the main cropping seasons (August-December) in 2002 and 2003 at Agarfa and Sinana in Bale highlands, Ethiopia. Severity, disease progress rate (r), and area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) were used to evaluate the effects of the treatments. The spray intervals significantly affected disease severity and varied the rate of epidemic development. Stripe rust epidemics varied significantly between locations, seasons, and among cultivars. The disease developed at a rate of 0.173-0.244 units per day on the susceptible cv. Wabe, 0.155-0.231 on the moderately resistant cv. Mitike, and 0.06-0.143 on the resistant cv. Madda-Walabu under natural disease epidemics. The severity and rate of stripe rust progression were significantly influenced by resistance of the cultivars. Fungicide application significantly reduced stripe rust severity and AUDPC by reducing its progress rate on the susceptible cultivar. Grain yield harvested from sprayed plots was consistently greater than the yield harvested from unsprayed plots. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The relationship between epidemiology and disease management is long-standing but sometimes tenuous. It may seem self-evident that improved understanding of epidemic processes will lead to more effective control practices but this remains a testable proposition rather than demonstrated reality. A wide range of models differing in mathematical sophistication and computational complexity has been proposed as a means of achieving a greater understanding of epidemiology and carrying this through to improved management. The potential exists to align these modeling approaches to evaluation of control practices and prediction of the consequent epidemic outcomes, but these have yet to make a major impact on practical disease management. For the immediate future simpler pragmatic approaches for analysis of disease progress, using nonlinear growth functions and/or integrated measures such as area under disease progress curves, will play a key role in informing tactical and strategic decisions on control treatments. These approaches have proved useful in describing control effectiveness and, in some cases, optimizing or changing control practices.},

abstract = {Calculation of the area under the disease-progress curve (AUDPC) as a measure of quantitative disease resistance entails repeated disease assessments. For typical sigmoid disease-progress curves, repeated assessments may be unnecessary. A mathematical procedure is derived for estimating the AUDPC from two data points. A field trial with ten cultivars with and without the gene Yr18 for resistance to stripe rust were inoculated with two pathotypes of Puccinia striiformis (from the cultivars Karamu and Oroua) and assessed for the percentage leaf area infected seven or eight times during the growing season. The AUDPCs were calculated directly from data and estimated from the described equation. Calculated values were plotted and ranked against estimated values, and excellent correspondence was obtained (Spearman’s Rank Correlation in the Karamu trial= 0.9879 and the Oroua trial=0.9515). Therefore, an estimation of the AUDPC from two data points provides an equivalent amount of information as from repeated assessments.},

abstract = {A DNA-based soil testing service operates in Australia to assist grain growers in predicting the likely extent of losses from various soilborne diseases well before a crop is planted. Growers, therefore, have the option of changing cultivars or modifying cropping programs in situations where the risk of crop loss is high. The service was launched in 1997 and although the initial focus was on wheat and barley, pathogens of rotation crops are now included. Key features of the service include a unique high-throughput DNA extraction system to process 500-g soil samples and a series of specific real-time PCR assays that allow a range of fungal and nematode pathogens to be quantified in a single soil sample. Tests for Heterodera avenae, Pratylenchus neglectus, P. thornei, Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, G. graminis var. avenae, Rhizoctonia solani AG-8, Fusarium pseudograminearum, F. culmorum and the pea pathogens Mycosphaerella pinodes and Phoma medicaginis var. pinodella are available at present, while tests for Bipolaris sorokiniana, Ditylenchus dipsaci and Pratylenchus teres are in development. This paper discusses issues that were addressed in establishing the service ( e. g. sampling strategies, extraction of DNA from soil, development of specific tests, disease risk categories) and explains the training and accreditation programs that have been established to ensure that results are interpreted adequately at the farm level. It also outlines research being conducted to extend the service to horticulture.},

abstract = {The area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) is frequently used to combine multiple observations of disease progress into a single value. However, our analysis shows that this approach severely underestimates the effect of the first and last observation. To get a better estimate of disease progress, we have developed a new formula termed the area under the disease progress stairs (AUDPS). The AUDPS approach improves the estimation of disease progress by giving a weight closer to optimal to the first and last observations. Analysis of real data indicates that AUDPS outperforms AUDPC in most of the tested trials and may be less precise than AUDPC only when assessments in the first or last observations have a comparatively large variance. We propose using AUDPS and its standardized (sAUDPS) and relative (rAUDPS) forms when combining multiple observations from disease progress experiments into a single value.},

abstract = {The recommendation of new plant varieties for commercial use requires reliable and accurate predictions of the average yield of each variety across a range of target environments and knowledge of important interactions with the environment. This information is obtained from series of plant variety trials, also known as multi-environment trials (MET). Cullis, Gogel, Verbyla, and Thompson (1998) presented a spatial mixed model approach for the analysis of MET data. In this paper we extend the analysis to include multiplicative models for the variety effects in each environment. The multiplicative model corresponds to that used in the multivariate technique of factor analysis. It allows a separate genetic variance for each environment and provides a parsimonious and interpretable model for the genetic covariances between environments. The model can be regarded as a random effects analogue of AMMI (additive main effects and multiplicative interactions). We illustrate the method using a large set of MET data from a South Australian barley breeding program.},
