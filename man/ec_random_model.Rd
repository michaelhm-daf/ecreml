\title{Identify the most parsimonious EC random effects model}
\usage{
ec_random_model(.fm, .ecs_in_model, .G, .M)
}
\arguments{
\item{.fm}{The current \code{asreml} model object that random environmental covariate terms will be tested from.}

\item{.ecs_in_model}{A list of expressions such that each expression is an environmental covariate that is present in the current model.}

\item{.G}{The genotype term in the model as an expression}

\item{.M}{The management practice term in the model as an expression}
}
\value{
An updated asreml model such that the non-significant environmental covariate spline terms have been removed from the model.
}
\description{
Performs the backwards selection procedure for the random component of the model to obtain a parsimonious random effects model
for the all environmental covariates currently in the model.
Testing for the significance of random effect terms is performed using the AIC criteria at the REML parameter estimates (Verbyla 2019).
