\title{Find the AIC and BIC for a set of models fitted using asreml}
\usage{
icREML(fm, scale = 1, logdet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{fm}{A \code{list} of asreml fitted model objects}

\item{scale}{A scalar to scale the variance matrix of the estimated
fixed effects (to ensure numerical stability of a log-determinant).
Default value is 1.}

\item{logdet}{The log determinant that modifies the residual
log-likelihood to form the full log-likelihood is to be included in the
table.}
}
\value{
A data frame.  The data frame has the following components
\itemize{
\item \code{model} : the names of the models
\item \code{loglik} : the full log-likelihood for each model
\item \code{p} :  the number of fixed effects parameters for each model
\item \code{q} : the number of (non-zero) variance parameters for each model.
\item \code{b} : the number of variance parameters that are fixed or on the
boundary.  These parameters are not counted in the AIC or BIC.
\item \code{AIC} : the AIC for each model
\item \code{BIC} : the BIC for each model
\item \code{logdet} : the log-determinant used in adjusting the residual
log-likelihood for each model
}
}
\description{
For a list of fitted asreml objects, finds the AIC and BIC for each
model in the list.
}
\details{
This function calculates the AIC and BIC for each fitted asreml model in a list.
Options are set and each model is updated.  The elements required for the AIC and
BIC are then calculated. This function has been slightly modified from the version in the
Verbyla (2019) paper
