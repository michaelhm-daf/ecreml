The `ecreml` `R`-package consists of a series of functions to aid
agricultural scientists and data analysts implement the statistical
methodology described in [Mumford et
al.Â (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037842902300326X),
which incorporates environmental covariates (ECs) into a
multi-environment trial (MET) analysis to better understand the
environmental drivers contributing to the genotype $\times$ environment
$\times$ management practice (G $\times$ E $\times$ M) interaction. The
overall aim of the `ecreml` `R`-package is to make it as easy as
possible for scientists to implement the statistical methodology for
their own MET data.
